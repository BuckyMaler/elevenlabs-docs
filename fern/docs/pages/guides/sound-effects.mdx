## Overview

<script src="https://elevenlabs.io/player/audioNativeHelper.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

ElevenLabs Sound Effects API turns text descriptions into high-quality audio effects with precise control over timing, style and complexity. The model understands both natural language and audio terminology, enabling you to:

- Generate cinematic sound design for films & trailers
- Create custom sound effects for games & interactive media
- Produce Foley and ambient sounds for video content

Listen to a sample cinematic impact:

<elevenlabs-audio-player
audio-title="Cinematic Impact"
audio-src="[URL_TO_SAMPLE_EFFECT]"
/>

## Quickstart

The `text_to_sound_effects` endpoint generates audio effects from text descriptions using two core parameters:

- `text`: The description of the desired sound effect
- `duration_seconds`: Optional length of the generated audio in seconds
- `prompt_influence`: Optional value between 0 and 1, where 0 is the most creative and 1 is the most literal interpretation

Execute the code below to generate your first sound effect:

<CodeBlocks>

```python title="Python" focus={5-7}
from elevenlabs import play
from elevenlabs import ElevenLabs

client = ElevenLabs()
sound_effect = client.text_to_sound_effects.convert(
    text="Glass shattering on concrete"
)
audio = b"".join(sound_effect)

play(audio)
```

</CodeBlocks>

## Prompting Guide

### Simple Effects

For basic sound effects, use clear, concise descriptions:

- "Glass shattering on concrete"
- "Heavy wooden door creaking open"
- "Thunder rumbling in the distance"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="Glass Shattering"
    audio-src="[URL_TO_GLASS_EFFECT]"
/>

### Complex Sequences

For multi-part sound effects, describe the sequence of events:

- "Footsteps on gravel, then a metallic door opens"
- "Wind whistling through trees, followed by leaves rustling"
- "Sword being drawn, then clashing with another blade"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="Footsteps and Door"
    audio-src="[URL_TO_SEQUENCE_EFFECT]"
/>

### Musical Elements

The API also supports generation of musical components:

- "90s hip-hop drum loop, 90 BPM"
- "Vintage brass stabs in F minor"
- "Atmospheric synth pad with subtle modulation"

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="Hip Hop Beat"
    audio-src="[URL_TO_MUSIC_EFFECT]"
/>

## Settings

Two parameters control the generation process:

- **Duration**: Set a specific length for the generated audio (in seconds)

  - Default: Automatically determined based on the prompt
  - Range: 0.1 to 30 seconds
  - Cost: 40 characters per second when duration is specified

- **Prompt Influence**: Control how strictly the model follows the prompt
  - High: More literal interpretation of the prompt
  - Low: More creative interpretation with added variations

## Audio Terminology

Common terms that can enhance your prompts:

- **Impact**: Collision or contact sounds between objects, from subtle taps to dramatic crashes
- **Whoosh**: Movement through air effects, ranging from fast and ghostly to slow-spinning or rhythmic
- **Ambience**: Background environmental sounds that establish atmosphere and space
- **One-shot**: Single, non-repeating sound
- **Loop**: Repeating audio segment
- **Stem**: Isolated audio component
- **Braam**: Big, brassy cinematic hit that signals epic or dramatic moments, common in trailers
- **Glitch**: Sounds of malfunction, jittering, or erratic movement, useful for transitions and sci-fi
- **Drone**: Continuous, textured sound that creates atmosphere and suspense

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the maximum duration for generated effects?">
    The maximum duration is 30 seconds per generation. For longer sequences, generate multiple
    effects and combine them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I generate music with this API?">
    Yes, you can generate musical elements like drum loops, bass lines, and melodic samples.
    However, for full music production, consider combining multiple generated elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I ensure consistent quality?">
    Use detailed prompts, appropriate duration settings, and high prompt influence for more
    predictable results. For complex sounds, generate components separately and combine them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What audio formats are supported?">
    Generated audio is provided in MP3 format with professional-grade quality (44.1kHz,
    128-192kbps).
