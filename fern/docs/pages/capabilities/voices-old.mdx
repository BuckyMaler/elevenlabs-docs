Default Voices

A curated set of voices for our core use cases.

Default voices are a curated set of voices optimized for our core use cases and made available to all ElevenLabs users by default. They come with a few core guarantees:

Long-term availability: we make our default voices via multi-year partnerships with voice actors
Consistent quality: our team carefully crafts and QCs our default voices to ensure they perform well across a range of use cases
Priority model support: our default voices are the first to receive fine tunings for new models as they are released
Note: Default voices were previously referred to as “premade” voices. The latter term is still used when accessing default voices via the API, e.g. when filtering by category == "premade". Please see the voices API documentation for more details.

Using Default Voices
Unlike voices you add from the Voice Library or new Instant Voice Clones (IVCs) or Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) you create, default voices are not accessed via your My Voices.

There are several ways you can find and use default voices:

Instead, there are 2 ways to find and use default voices:

My Voices: Default voices can be found in My Voices, under either the “All” or the “Default” tabs. Default voices do not take up any of your custom voice slots, and cannot be removed from My Voices. You can use Default voices directly from My Voices by clicking “Use”. This will open Speech Synthesis with the voice already selected.

API: Calls to the /voices endpoint will fetch all default voices in addition to voices added to My Voices. See the voices API documentation for more details.

Voice dropdown menu: Default voices can be selected from the voice dropdown menu. In Speech Synthesis, this can be accessed by clicking the voice name in the bottom left-hand corner of the text-to-speech or voice changer screen:

You’ll find our default voices under the “Default” heading, or alternatively, you can search for the name of the voice you want to use. To hear a sample of the voice, click the circular icon next to the voice name.

Current Default Voices
Below is a list of our current default voices, including metadata and sample audio. Please note that all of our current default voices have fine tunings for our Flash/Turbo v2, Flash/Turbo v2.5, and Multilingual v2 models, which means they are optimized for use with these models.

How do Default Voices sound in my language?
Our default voices can be used to generate audio in any of the 32 languages we support by using them with one of our multilingual models (e.g. Multilingual v2, v2.5 Flash or Turbo v2.5).
Some default voices may have unpredicable accents in other languages.
We are working to provide a granular overview of how each default voice sounds in each of the languages we support and will update this page when this is ready.
Legacy Voices
Below is a list of our legacy voices, which can be accesssed in 2 ways:

UI: Search for the name of the legacy voice you’re looking for in any voice dropdown, or go to My Voices -> Default, and look for voices with “Legacy” in the name.
API: To see legacy voices when calling the /voices endpoint, you need to set the show_legacy query parameter to True. Please see the voices API documentation for more details.
Note: Legacy voices will remain available for the foreseeable future, but they are less consistent than default voices and will not receive priority support for future model releases. For more information on Legacy voices, please see What are Legacy voices?

Voice Design

Generate a unique voice from a text prompt.

Voice Design helps creators fill the gaps when the exact voice they are looking for isn’t available in the Voice Library. Now if you can’t find a suitable voice for your project, you can create one. Note that Voice Design is highly experimental and Professional Voice Clones are still the highest quality voices on our platform. If there is a PVC available in our library that fits your needs, we recommend using it.

You can find Voice Design by heading to Voices -> My Voices -> Add a new voice -> Voice Design.

When you hit generate, we’ll generate three voice options for you. The only charge for using voice design is the number of credits to generate your preview text, which you are only charged once even though we are generating three samples for you. You can see the number of characters that will be deducated in the “Text to preview” text box.

After generating, you’ll have the option to select and save one of the generations, which will take up one of your voice slots.

Voice Design Prompt Guide
Voice Design Types
Type Description Example Prompts
Realistic Voice Design Create an original, realistic voice by specifying age, accent/nationality, gender, tone, pitch, intonation, speed, and emotion. - “A young Indian female with a soft, high voice. Conversational, slow and calm.”

- “An old British male with a raspy, deep voice. Professional, relaxed and assertive.”
- “A middle-aged Australian female with a warm, low voice. Corporate, fast and happy.”
  Character Voice Design Generate unique voices for creative characters using simpler prompts. - “A massive evil ogre, troll”
- “A sassy little squeaky mouse”

Instant Voice Cloning

Guide for getting the most out of you cloned voices.

Instant Voice Cloning (IVC) allows you to create voice clones form shorter samples near instantaneously. Creating an instant voice clone does not train or create a custom AI model. Instead, it relies on prior knowledge from training data to make an educated guess rather than training on the exact voice. This works extremely well for a lot of voices.

However, the biggest limitation of IVC is if you are trying to clone a very unique voice with a very unique accent where the AI might not have heard a similar voices before during training. In such cases, creating a custom model with explicit training using Professional Voice Cloning (PVC) might be the best option.

Voice Creation
When cloning a voice, it’s important to consider what the AI has been trained on: which languages and what type of dataset. In this case, you can find the languages for each model here, and the dataset is quite varied, especially for the multilingual v2. You can read more about each individual model here and their strengths.

As mentioned earlier, if the voice you try to clone falls outside of these parameters or outside of what the AI has heard during training, it might have a hard time replicating the voice perfectly using instant voice cloning.

How the audio was recorded is more important than the total length (total runtime) of the samples. The number of samples you use doesn’t matter; it is the total combined length (total runtime) that is the important part.

Approximately 1-2 minutes of clear audio without any reverb, artifacts, or background noise of any kind appears to be the sweet spot. When we speak of “audio or recording quality,” we do not mean the codec, such as MP3 or WAV; we mean how the audio was captured. However, regarding audio codecs, using MP3 at 128 kbps and above seems to work just fine, and higher bitrates don’t seem to markedly improve the quality of the clone.

The AI will attempt to mimic everything it hears in the audio; the speed of the person talking as well as the inflections, the accent and tonality, breathing pattern and strength, as well as noise and mouth clicks and everything else, including noise and artefacts which can confuse it.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that the AI will try to replicate the performance of the voice you provide. If you talk in a slow, monotone voice without much emotion, that is what the AI will mimic. On the other hand, if you talk quickly with much emotion, that is what the AI will try to replicate.

It is crucial that the voice remains consistent throughout all the samples, not only in tone but also in performance. If there is too much variance, it might confuse the AI, leading to more varied output between generations.

The most important aspect to get a proper clone is the voice itself, the language and accent, and the quality of the recording.
Audio length is less important than quality but still plays an important role up to a certain point. At a minimum, input audio should be 1 minute long. Avoid adding beyond 3 minutes; this will yield little improvement and can, in some cases, even be detrimental to the clone, making it more unstable.
Keep the audio consistent. Ensure that the voice maintains a consistent tone throughout, with a consistent performance. Also, make sure that the audio quality of the voice remains consistent across all the samples. Even if you only use a single sample, ensure that it remains consistent throughout the full sample. Feeding the AI audio that is very dynamic, meaning wide fluctuations in pitch and volume, will yield less predictable results.
Find a good balance for the volume so the audio is neither too quiet nor too loud. The ideal would be between -23 dB and -18 dB RMS with a true peak of -3 dB.
If you are unsure about what is permissible from a legal standpoint, please consult the Terms of Service and our AI Safety information for more information.

Professional Voice Cloning

Guide to getting the highest quality voice clone available.

The video is currently slightly outdated as we’ve released new features since it was made, and the training time is significantly quicker. However, a lot of the information in it is still relevant.

Professional Voice Cloning (PVC), unlike Instant Voice Cloning (IVC) which lets you clone voices with very short samples nearly instantaneously, allows you to train a hyper-realistic model of a voice. This is achieved by training a dedicated model on a large set of voice data to produce a model that’s indistinguishable from the original voice.

Since the custom models require fine-tuning and training, it will take a bit longer to train these Professional Voice Clones compared to the Instant Voice Clones. Giving an estimate is challenging as it depends on the number of people in the queue before you and a few other factors.

Here are the current estimates for Professional Voice Cloning:

English: ~3 hours
Multilingual: ~6 hours
Voice Creation
There are a few things to be mindful of before you start uploading your samples, and some steps that you need to take to ensure the best possible results.

Firstly, Professional Voice Cloning is highly accurate in cloning the samples used for its training. It will create a near-perfect clone of what it hears, including all the intricacies and characteristics of that voice, but also including any artifacts and unwanted audio present in the samples. This means that if you upload low-quality samples with background noise, room reverb/echo, or any other type of unwanted sounds like music on multiple people speaking, the AI will try to replicate all of these elements in the clone as well.

Secondly, make sure there’s only a single speaking voice throughout the audio, as more than one speaker or excessive noise or anything of the above can confuse the AI. This confusion can result in the AI being unable to discern which voice to clone or misinterpreting what the voice actually sounds like because it is being masked by other sounds, leading to a less-than-optimal clone.

Thirdly, make sure you have enough material to clone the voice properly. The bare minimum we recommend is 30 minutes of audio, but for the optimal result and the most accurate clone, we recommend closer to 3 hours of audio. You might be able to get away with less, but at that point, we can’t vouch for the quality of the resulting clone.

Fourthly, the speaking style in the samples you provide will be replicated in the output, so depending on what delivery you are looking for, the training data should correspond to that style (e.g. if you are looking to voice an audiobook with a clone of your voice, the audio you submit for training should be a recording of you reading a book in the tone of voice you want to use). It is better to just include one style in the uploaded samples for consistencies sake.

Lastly, it’s best to use samples speaking where you are speaking the language that the PVC will mainly be used for. Of course, the AI can speak any language that we currently support. However, it is worth noting that if the voice itself is not native to the language you want the AI to speak - meaning you cloned a voice speaking a different language - it might have an accent from the original language and might mispronounce words and inflections. For instance, if you clone a voice speaking English and then want it to speak Spanish, it will very likely have an English accent when speaking Spanish. We only support cloning samples recorded in one of our supported languages, and the application will reject your sample if it is recorded in an unsupported language.

For now, we only allow you to clone your own voice. You will be asked to go through a verification process before submitting your fine-tuning request.

Professional Recording Equipment: Use high-quality recording equipment for optimal results as the AI will clone everything about the audio. High-quality input = high-quality output. Any microphone will work, but an XLR mic going into a dedicated audio interface would be our recommendation. A few general recommendations on low-end would be something like an Audio Technica AT2020 or a Rode NT1 going into a Focusrite interface or similar.
Use a Pop-Filter: Use a Pop-Filter when recording. This will minimize plosives when recording.
Microphone Distance: Position yourself at the right distance from the microphone - approximately two fists away from the mic is recommended, but it also depends on what type of recording you want.
Noise-Free Recording: Ensure that the audio input doesn’t have any interference, like background music or noise. The AI cloning works best with clean, uncluttered audio.
Room Acoustics: Preferably, record in an acoustically-treated room. This reduces unwanted echoes and background noises, leading to clearer audio input for the AI. You can make something temporary using a thick duvet or quilt to dampen the recording space.
Audio Pre-processing: Consider editing your audio beforehand if you’re aiming for a specific sound you want the AI to output. For instance, if you want a polished podcast-like output, pre-process your audio to match that quality, or if you have long pauses or many “uhm”s and “ahm”s between words as the AI will mimic those as well.
Volume Control: Maintain a consistent volume that’s loud enough to be clear but not so loud that it causes distortion. The goal is to achieve a balanced and steady audio level. The ideal would be between -23dB and -18dB RMS with a true peak of -3dB.
Sufficient Audio Length: Provide at least 30 minutes of high-quality audio that follows the above guidelines for best results - preferably closer to 3 hours of audio. The more quality data you can feed into the AI, the better the voice clone will be. The number of samples is irrelevant; the total runtime is what matters. However, if you plan to upload multiple hours of audio, it is better to split it into multiple ~30-minute samples. This makes it easier to upload.
Uploading: After pressing upload, you will not be able to make any changes to the clone and it will be locked in. Ensure that you have uploaded the correct samples that you want to you.
Verify Your Voice: Once everything is recorded and uploaded, you will be asked to verify your voice. To ensure a smooth experience, please try to verify your voice using the same or similar equipment used to record the samples and in a tone and delivery that is similar to what was present in the samples. If you do not have access to the same equipment, try verifying the best you can. If it fails, you will have to reach out to support.
Keep in mind that all of this depends on the output you want. The AI will try to clone everything in the audio, but for the AI to work optimally and predictably, we suggest following the guidelines mentioned above.

Once you’ve uploaded your samples, there are four stages of the cloning process that you might see on your voice card.

Verify: This means that they have uploaded the voice samples, but you have not yet finished the verification step. You will need to finish this step before it can start training.
Processing: This means that the voice has been verified and is preprocessing, ready to be trained. When you’ve reached this step, the rest is automatic, and you will not need to do anything.
Fine-tuning: This is when the voice is actually training. Along with this label, you will also see a loading bar to show you the progress.
Fine-tuned: This means the voice has finished training and is ready to be used!
Scripts
What you read is not very important; how you read it is very important, however. The AI will try to mimic everything it hears in a voice: the tonal quality, the accent, the inflection, and many other intricate details. It will replicate how you pronounce certain words, vowels, and consonants, but not the actual words themselves. So, it is better to choose a text or script that conveys the emotion you want to capture, and read in a tone of voice you want to use.

Overview

Discover AI voices from the ElevenLabs community

The Voice Library (VL) is a marketplace where our community can share voices and earn rewards when they’re used. At the moment, only Professional Voice Clones (PVCs) can be shared in the library. Instant Voice Clones (IVCs) cannot be shared for safety reasons.

Using voices from the Voice Library
You can play a sample for any voice in the Voice Library by clicking it.

To use a voice from the Voice Library, you first need to add it to My Voices. To do this, click “Add”. This will save it to My Voices using the default name for the voice. You can use it directly from the Voice Library by clicking “Use”, which will open Speech Synthesis with the voice selected.

Once the voice has been added to My Voices, it will appear in the voice selection menu across all features.

Details view
You can find out more information about a voice by clicking “View”. This opens up a pane on the right which contains more information. Here you can see all the tags associated with the voice, including:

the language it was trained on
the age and gender of the voice
the category, for example, “Conversational”
how long the notice period is, if the voice has one
if the voice has been labelled as High Quality
what type of voice it is, for example, Professional Voice Clone
You can also see how many users have saved the voice to My Voices, and how many characters of audio have been generated with the voice.

Finally, you can also see suggestions of similar voices, and can play samples and add these to My Voices if you want.

Category
Some labels tell you about the type of voice:

Voice Design voices are no longer shareable in the Voice Library; however, the legacy shared voices will remain accessible.

Voice Design
Generated voices made using Voice Design

Professional Voice Clone
Voices made using Professional Voice Cloning

HQ
The HQ label stands for High Quality, and indicates that this Professional Voice Clone has been trained on audio which follows our Professional Recording Guidelines and has passed a quality control check on input texts of various lengths.

Sharing Options
Other labels tell you about options the voice owner set when sharing the voice. Please see the Sharing page for more details.

Notice Period
A label with a clock icon indicates that the voice has a Notice Period in place. The Notice Period lets you now how long you’ll continue to have access to the voice if the voice owner decides to remove it from the Voice Library.

Credit Multiplier
Some voices have a credit multiplier in place. This is shown by a label displaying, for example, x2 multiplier or x3 multiplier. This means that the voice owner has set a custom rate for use of their voice. Please pay close attention, as credit multipliers mean your account will be deducted >1x the number of credits when you generate using a voice that has a credit multiplier.

Live Moderation
Some voices have “Live Moderation” enabled. This is indicated with a label with a shield icon. When you generate using a voice with Live Moderation enabled, we use tools to check whether the text being generated belongs to a number of prohibited categories. This may introduce extra latency when using the voice, and voices with Live Moderation enabled cannot be used in Projects.

Filters, Sorting, and Search
To help you find the perfect voice for you, the Voice Library is searchable and filterable.

Search box
You can use the search box to search by name, keyword and voice ID. You can also search by dragging and dropping an audio file, or uploading a file by clicking the upload icon. This will return the voice used, if it can be found, along with similar voices.

Sort by
You have a number of options for sorting voices in the Voice Library:

Trending: voices are ranked by our trending algorithm
Latest: newest voices are shown first
Most users
Most characters generated
Language filter
The language filter allows you to return only voices that have been trained on audio in a specific language. While all voices are compatible with our multilingual models and can therefore be used with all 32 languages we support, voices labelled with a specific language should perform well for content in that language

Accent filter
If you select a specific language, the Accent filter will also become available. This allows you to look for voices with specific accents.

More filters
Click the “More filters” button to access additional filters.

Sharing Voices

Learn how to share voices in the Voice Library.

How to share a voice model in the Voice Library:

1. Share Button: To get started with sharing a voice model, find the voice model you want to share in My Voices and click the share icon:

2. Sharing Toggle: Next, activate sharing by enabling the “Sharing” toggle. Note that this doesn’t make your voice model automatically discoverable in the Voice Library.

3. Sharing Link/Email Whitelist: Once the “Sharing” toggle is enabled, you have a few ways to share your Voice Model:

Sharing Link: share this link with your audience, your friends, or anyone else that you want to be able to make a copy of your voice model in My Voices.
Email Whitelist: you can specify specific emails to restrict who can make copies of your voice model in My Voices using your Sharing Link. If you leave the whitelist blank, all emails will be enabled by default.
Discovery in Voice Library: this makes your voice model discoverable in the Voice Library and takes you to the sharing dialog detailed in Step 4 below. 4. Library Sharing Options: if you enable “Discovery in Voice Library”, you’ll be brought to a dialog screen where you can configure a few options for sharing your voice model in the Voice Library:

Please see the Voice Library Addendum to our Terms of Service for full descriptions of these options.

5. Naming Guidelines: Please ensure the name you give your voice model adheres to the guidelines shown in the sharing dialog:

The naming pattern should be a one-word name followed by a 2-4 word description, separated by a hyphen (-).

Your name should NOT include the following:

Names of public individuals or entities (company names, band names, influencers or famous people, etc).
Social handles (Twitter, Instagram, you name it, etc).
ALL CAPS WORDS.
Emojis and any other non-letter characters.
Explicit or harmful words.
The word “voice”.
Some examples of names following our guidelines:

Anna - calm and kind
Robert - friendly grandpa
Steve - wise teacher
Harmony - soothing serenader
Jasper - jovial storyteller
Maya - confident narrator 6. Scroll and accept terms: Before sharing your voice model in the Voice Library, you’ll be asked to scroll and accept the Voice Library Addendum to our Terms of Service and provide additional consents and confirmations. Please do this carefully and ensure you fully understand our service before sharing. If you have any questions at this stage, you can reach out to us at legal@elevenlabs.io.

Before you share your voice to the Voice Library, we have a few guidelines that need to be followed. These guidelines are in place to ensure better discoverability and to maintain a clean and organized appearance for everyone using the platform. Please take the time to read through the guidelines below. They will help you understand how you should name, categorize, and tag your voice to enhance the overall experience for users.

Review
Once you’ve created, named, and shared your voice, it will be set for pending review. This means that someone from the ElevenLabs team will go through your voice to ensure that it adheres to the guidelines outlined above. If there are significant issues, your request to share the voice model will be declined. If only small changes are required, the team might make these adjustments for you and approve the voice model for sharing.

As part of the review process, our team may add labels to your voice model to make it discoverable using the filters for the Voice Library:

Gender
Accent
Language (the language of the source audio used to create your PVC)
Age
Use case
Descriptive
Consistently uploading voices that do not adhere to the guidelines or are highly explicit in nature might result in being barred from uploading and sharing voices altogether. Therefore, please adhere to the guidelines.

Currently, we do not have an estimate of how long the review process will take, as it is highly dependent on the length of the queue.
