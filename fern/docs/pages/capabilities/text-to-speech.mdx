## Overview

ElevenLabs [Text to Speech (TTS)](/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech) turns text into lifelike audio with nuanced intonation, pacing and emotional awareness. [Our models](/docs/models) adapt to textual cues across 32 languages and multiple voice styles and can be used to:

- Narrate global media campaigns & ads
- Produce audiobooks in multiple languages with complex emotional delivery
- Stream real-time audio from text

Listen to a sample:

<elevenlabs-audio-player
    audio-title="George"
    audio-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/eleven-public-cdn/audio/marketing/george.mp3"
/>

Explore our [Voice Library](https://elevenlabs.io/community) to find the perfect voice for your project.

### Voice quality

For real-time applications, Flash v2.5 provides ultra-low 75ms latency, while Multilingual v2 delivers the highest quality audio with more nuanced expression.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I fine-tune the emotional range of the generated audio?">
    The models interpret emotional context directly from the text input. For example, adding
    descriptive text like "she said excitedly" or using exclamation marks will influence the speech
    emotion. Voice settings like Stability and Similarity help control the consistency, while the
    underlying emotion comes from textual cues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I clone my own voice or a specific speaker's voice?">
    Yes. Instant Voice Cloning quickly mimics another speaker from short clips. For high-fidelity
    clones, check out our Professional Voice Clone.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I own the audio output?">
    Yes. You retain ownership of any audio you generate. However, commercial usage rights are only
    available with paid plans. With a paid subscription, you may use generated audio for commercial
    purposes and monetize the outputs if you own the IP rights to the input content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I reduce latency for real-time cases?">
    Use the low-latency Flash models (Flash v2 or v2.5) optimized for near real-time conversational
    or interactive scenarios. See our [latency optimization guide](/docs/latency-optimization) for
    more details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my output sometimes inconsistent?">
    The models are nondeterministic. For consistency, use the optional seed parameter, though subtle
    differences may still occur.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the best practice for large text conversions?">
    Split long text into segments and use streaming for real-time playback and efficient processing.
    To maintain natural prosody flow between chunks, use `previous_text` or `previous_request_ids`.
