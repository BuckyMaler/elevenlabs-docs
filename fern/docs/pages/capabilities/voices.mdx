-- OLD to del

My Voices is your personal voice HQ. Here you can:

- Create new <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-lab/instant-voice-cloning">Instant Voice Clones (IVCs)</a>, <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-lab/professional-voice-cloning">Professional Voice Clones (PVCs)</a>, and generate new voices using [Voice Design.](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-lab/voice-design)
- View all of your custom voices, including those added from the <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-library/overview">Voice Library</a>

## Search and filter

My Voices includes a search box, so you can easily find voices by searching for the name, words from the description, or tags.
You can sort voices either alphabetically, or by most recently use, and you can filter by voice type. By default, all voice types are selected, but you can also filter for Professional Voice Clones, Instant Voice Clones or Generated Voices.

## Voice Categories

My Voices includes several tabs which allow you to filter your voices by type.

- **All**: All the voices currently saved in My Voices, including [Default](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/default-voices) voices. Default voices cannot be deleted from My Voices, and do not take up any of your custom voice slots.
- **Personal**: Voices that you have created - Professional Voice Clones, Instant Voice Clones and voices generated using Voice Design.
- **Community**: Voices you have saved from the Voice Library.
- **Default**: All Default voices.

## Tags and Labels

You can give voices in My Voices (including those added from the Voice Library) custom names, descriptions, and tags. This allows you to organize My Voices as you wish and store custom attributes. However, please note that these changes will not reflect on shared versions of your voices. To edit shared names, descriptions, and labels, please set these values when <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-library/sharing">sharing your voice in the Voice Library</a>.

## Deleting voices

You can only delete voices that you have created or saved from the Voice Library. Default and Legacy voices cannot be deleted, but they don't take up any of your custom voice slots. Voices that you have created using Instant and Professional Voice Cloning and Voice Design, as well as voices you've saved from the Voice Library, use your custom voice slots.

You can free up voice slots by deleting these voices. To delete a voice, first click "View" to open the detailed view for the voice. Then click "Delete" in the bottom left corner. You can use the "Personal" and "Community" tabs to easily identify voices that use your custom voice slots, and can be deleted.

## Sharing voices

Only Professional Voice Clones can be shared with other users. Instant Voice Clones and voices created using Voice Design cannot be shared.

Professional Voice Clones can be shared privately, via a sharing link, or publicly via the Voice Library. For full details on how to share your Professional Voice Clone, please see [Sharing Voices.](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/voices/voice-library/sharing)

# Voices (from workflows)

<Frame>
  <img src="../../product/guides/images/account-creation.webp" />
</Frame>

The Voices feature allows you to manage and create voices, both private to you and the ones made publicly available by our community (via the Voice Library).

### My voices

Within the **My Voices** section, you will be able to see all the voices that you have added to your account as well as the voices provided to you by default.

Before adding new voices, it's important to understand the three types of voices that you are able to create using ElevenLabs:

1. **Voice Design Voices** - Randomly computer-generated voices. More information available [here](/docs/product/voices/voice-lab/voice-design).
2. **Professional Voice Clones (PVCs)** - A PVC is an ultra-realistic, custom AI model of your voice. This is done by training our specialized model with longer voice data (at least 30 mins and up to 3 hours for optimum results) to make it sound just like the original voice.
3. **Instant Voice Clones (ICVs)** - Voice clones based on short audio clips. Unlike PVCs that create an AI model of the voice, it relies on prior knowledge from training data to make an educated guess rather than training on the exact voice. More information available [here](/docs/product/voices/voice-lab/instant-voice-cloning).

With that in mind, let’s create a brand-new voice!

<Frame>
  <img width="400" src="../../product/guides/images/type-of-voice.webp" />
</Frame>

### How to Create Voices

1. **Click on Add a new Voice** to open the following pop-up and select the voice you would like to create, from there follow the guidelines provided by the in-app pop-up window to create the voice you desire.
2. **Important for Voice Clones**:

<Note>
  {' '}
  With every Voice Clone, it is important that you have the person’s permission to clone their
  voice.
</Note>
- Please ensure the audio is recorded without any background sounds, ideally with good equipment and
with the tonality, cadence, and performance style you would like to recreate with your generations.
Sub-par audio quality will influence the outputs of your generations. For optimal results, we highly
recommend following our [guide to Audio
Recording](/docs/product/voices/pvc-step-by-step-guide#beginners-guide-to-audio-recording). - If
background noises cannot be avoided, you can use [Voice
Isolator](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/voice-isolator) to retrieve the voice and rid yourself of
unwanted background noise. 3. Once you’re done generating or creating your voice, it will be made
available to you and you alone in the **My Voices** section.

**Exercise**: Create a Voice Design voice (or clone a voice if you have the necessary permissions) with the knowledge you have gained from this section.

### Sharing your voice

1. Click on the share button for the voice you want to share.
2. Enable the sharing toggle.
3. Share the link with the colleague or place it in your document/intranet.

**Exercise**: Share a voice with a colleague.

### Library voices

You are also able to add voices from our community marketplace via the **Library**. Simply click on the **Add Voice** button for the voice that you want to share.

**Exercise**: Add a voice from the Library to your **Voices**.
