## Overview

The [Payouts](https://elevenlabs.io/payouts) (VL) system allows you to earn rewards for sharing voices in the Voice Library. ElevenLabs uses <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">Stripe Connect</a> to process payments.

## Tracking usage and earnings

- You can track the usage of your voices by going to your <a href="/docs/product/voices/voice-lab/overview">My Voices</a>, clicking "View" to open the detailed view for your voice, then clicking the sharing icon at the bottom. Once you have the Sharing Options open, click "View Metrics".
- The rewards you earn are based on the options you selected when <a href="/docs/product/voices/voice-library/sharing">sharing your voice in the Voice Library</a>.
- You can also see your all-time earnings and past payouts by going back to your Payouts page

## Reader app rewards

- If your voice is marked as **[High-Quality](/docs/product/voices/voice-library/overview#category)** and you have activated the "Available in ElevenReader" toggle, your voice will made be available in the ElevenReader. Rewards for ElevenReader are reported separately â€“ to view your Reader App rewards, check the "ElevenReader" box on your "View Metrics" screen.

## Things to know

- Rewards accumulate frequently throughout the day, but payouts typically happen once a week as long as you have more than $10 in accrued payouts. You can see your past payouts by going to your [Payouts](https://elevenlabs.io/app/payouts) page in the sidebar.
