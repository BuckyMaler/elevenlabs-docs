## Overview

## Instant Voice Cloning (IVC)

</Frame>

Instant Voice Cloning (IVC) allows you to create voice clones form shorter samples near instantaneously. Creating an instant voice clone does not train or create a custom AI model. Instead, it relies on prior knowledge from training data to make an educated guess rather than training on the exact voice. This works extremely well for a lot of voices.

However, the biggest limitation of IVC is if you are trying to clone a very unique voice with a very unique accent where the AI might not have heard a similar voices before during training. In such cases, creating a custom model with explicit training using Professional Voice Cloning (PVC) might be the best option.

## Voice Creation

When cloning a voice, it's important to consider what the AI has been trained on: which languages and what type of dataset. In this case, you can find the languages for each model [here](https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/17883183930129-What-models-do-you-offer-and-what-is-the-difference-between-them-), and the dataset is quite varied, especially for the `multilingual v2`. You can read more about each individual model [here](/docs/product/speech-synthesis/models) and their strengths.

As mentioned earlier, if the voice you try to clone falls outside of these parameters or outside of what the AI has heard during training, it might have a hard time replicating the voice perfectly using instant voice cloning.

How the audio was recorded is more important than the total length (total runtime) of the samples. The number of samples you use doesn't matter; it is the total combined length (total runtime) that is the important part.

Approximately 1-2 minutes of clear audio without any reverb, artifacts, or background noise of any kind appears to be the sweet spot. When we speak of "audio or recording quality," we do not mean the codec, such as MP3 or WAV; we mean how the audio was captured. However, regarding audio codecs, using MP3 at 128 kbps and above seems to work just fine, and higher bitrates don't seem to markedly improve the quality of the clone.

The AI will attempt to mimic everything it hears in the audio; the speed of the person talking as well as the inflections, the accent and tonality, breathing pattern and strength, as well as noise and mouth clicks and everything else, including noise and artefacts which can confuse it.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that the AI will try to replicate the performance of the voice you provide. If you talk in a slow, monotone voice without much emotion, that is what the AI will mimic. On the other hand, if you talk quickly with much emotion, that is what the AI will try to replicate.

It is crucial that the voice remains consistent throughout all the samples, not only in tone but also in performance. If there is too much variance, it might confuse the AI, leading to more varied output between generations.

- The most important aspect to get a proper clone is the voice itself, the language and accent, and the quality of the recording.
- Audio length is less important than quality but still plays an important role up to a certain point. At a minimum, input audio should be 1 minute long. Avoid adding beyond 3 minutes; this will yield little improvement and can, in some cases, even be detrimental to the clone, making it more unstable.
- Keep the audio consistent. Ensure that the voice maintains a consistent tone throughout, with a consistent performance. Also, make sure that the audio quality of the voice remains consistent across all the samples. Even if you only use a single sample, ensure that it remains consistent throughout the full sample. Feeding the AI audio that is very dynamic, meaning wide fluctuations in pitch and volume, will yield less predictable results.
- Find a good balance for the volume so the audio is neither too quiet nor too loud. The ideal would be between -23 dB and -18 dB RMS with a true peak of -3 dB.

If you are unsure about what is permissible from a legal standpoint, please consult the [Terms of Service](https://elevenlabs.io/terms-of-use) and our [AI Safety information](https://elevenlabs.io/safety) for more information.

Professional Voice Cloning (PVC), unlike Instant Voice Cloning (IVC) which lets you clone voices with very short samples nearly instantaneously, allows you to train a hyper-realistic model of a voice. This is achieved by training a dedicated model on a large set of voice data to produce a model that’s indistinguishable from the original voice.

Since the custom models require fine-tuning and training, it will take a bit longer to train these Professional Voice Clones compared to the Instant Voice Clones. Giving an estimate is challenging as it depends on the number of people in the queue before you and a few other factors.

Here are the current estimates for Professional Voice Cloning:

- **English:** ~3 hours
- **Multilingual:** ~6 hours

## Voice Creation

There are a few things to be mindful of before you start uploading your samples, and some steps that you need to take to ensure the best possible results.

Firstly, Professional Voice Cloning is highly accurate in cloning the samples used for its training. It will create a near-perfect clone of what it hears, including all the intricacies and characteristics of that voice, but also including any artifacts and unwanted audio present in the samples. This means that if you upload low-quality samples with background noise, room reverb/echo, or any other type of unwanted sounds like music on multiple people speaking, the AI will try to replicate all of these elements in the clone as well.

Secondly, make sure there's only a single speaking voice throughout the audio, as more than one speaker or excessive noise or anything of the above can confuse the AI. This confusion can result in the AI being unable to discern which voice to clone or misinterpreting what the voice actually sounds like because it is being masked by other sounds, leading to a less-than-optimal clone.

Thirdly, make sure you have enough material to clone the voice properly. The bare minimum we recommend is 30 minutes of audio, but for the optimal result and the most accurate clone, we recommend closer to 2+ hours of audio. You might be able to get away with less, but at that point, we can’t vouch for the quality of the resulting clone.

Fourthly, the speaking style in the samples you provide will be replicated in the output, so depending on what delivery you are looking for, the training data should correspond to that style (e.g. if you are looking to voice an audiobook with a clone of your voice, the audio you submit for training should be a recording of you reading a book in the tone of voice you want to use). It is better to just include one style in the uploaded samples for consistencies sake.

Lastly, it’s best to use samples speaking where you are speaking the language that the PVC will mainly be used for. Of course, the AI can speak any language that we currently support. However, it is worth noting that if the voice itself is not native to the language you want the AI to speak - meaning you cloned a voice speaking a different language - it might have an accent from the original language and might mispronounce words and inflections. For instance, if you clone a voice speaking English and then want it to speak Spanish, it will very likely have an English accent when speaking Spanish. We only support cloning samples recorded in one of our supported languages, and the application will reject your sample if it is recorded in an unsupported language.

For now, we only allow you to clone your own voice. You will be asked to go through a verification process before submitting your fine-tuning request.

- **Professional Recording Equipment:** Use high-quality recording equipment for optimal results as the AI will clone everything about the audio. High-quality input = high-quality output. Any microphone will work, but an XLR mic going into a dedicated audio interface would be our recommendation. A few general recommendations on low-end would be something like an Audio Technica AT2020 or a Rode NT1 going into a Focusrite interface or similar.
- **Use a Pop-Filter:** Use a Pop-Filter when recording. This will minimize plosives when recording.
- **Microphone Distance:** Position yourself at the right distance from the microphone - approximately two fists away from the mic is recommended, but it also depends on what type of recording you want.
- **Noise-Free Recording:** Ensure that the audio input doesn't have any interference, like background music or noise. The AI cloning works best with clean, uncluttered audio.
- **Room Acoustics:** Preferably, record in an acoustically-treated room. This reduces unwanted echoes and background noises, leading to clearer audio input for the AI. You can make something temporary using a thick duvet or quilt to dampen the recording space.
- **Audio Pre-processing:** Consider editing your audio beforehand if you're aiming for a specific sound you want the AI to output. For instance, if you want a polished podcast-like output, pre-process your audio to match that quality, or if you have long pauses or many "uhm"s and "ahm"s between words as the AI will mimic those as well.
- **Volume Control:** Maintain a consistent volume that's loud enough to be clear but not so loud that it causes distortion. The goal is to achieve a balanced and steady audio level. The ideal would be between -23dB and -18dB RMS with a true peak of -3dB.
- **Sufficient Audio Length:** Provide at least 30 minutes of high-quality audio that follows the above guidelines for best results - preferably closer to 2+ hours of audio. The more quality data you can feed into the AI, the better the voice clone will be. The number of samples is irrelevant; the total runtime is what matters. However, if you plan to upload multiple hours of audio, it is better to split it into multiple ~30-minute samples. This makes it easier to upload.
- **Uploading:** After pressing upload, you will not be able to make any changes to the clone and it will be locked in. Ensure that you have uploaded the correct samples that you want to you.
- **Verify Your Voice:** Once everything is recorded and uploaded, you will be asked to verify your voice. To ensure a smooth experience, please try to verify your voice using the same or similar equipment used to record the samples and in a tone and delivery that is similar to what was present in the samples. If you do not have access to the same equipment, try verifying the best you can. If it fails, you will have to reach out to support.

Keep in mind that all of this depends on the output you want. The AI will try to clone everything in the audio, but for the AI to work optimally and predictably, we suggest following the guidelines mentioned above.

Once you've uploaded your samples, there are four stages of the cloning process that you might see on your voice card.

- **Verify:** This means that they have uploaded the voice samples, but you have not yet finished the verification step. You will need to finish this step before it can start training.
- **Processing:** This means that the voice has been verified and is preprocessing, ready to be trained. When you've reached this step, the rest is automatic, and you will not need to do anything.
- **Fine-tuning:** This is when the voice is actually training. Along with this label, you will also see a loading bar to show you the progress.
- **Fine-tuned:** This means the voice has finished training and is ready to be used!

## Scripts

What you read is not very important; how you read it is very important, however. The AI will try to mimic everything it hears in a voice: the tonal quality, the accent, the inflection, and many other intricate details. It will replicate how you pronounce certain words, vowels, and consonants, but not the actual words themselves. So, it is better to choose a text or script that conveys the emotion you want to capture, and read in a tone of voice you want to use.

## What is a Professional Voice Clone (PVC)?

A Professional Voice Clone (PVC) is a special feature that is available to our Creator+ plans. A PVC is an ultra-realistic, custom AI model of your voice. This is done by training our specialized model with longer voice data (at least 30 mins and up to 2+ hours for optimum results) to make it sound just like the original voice.

Essentially, a PVC is a more advanced version of our Instant Voice Cloning feature. For now, we only allow you to clone your own voice. You will be asked to go through a verification process with our voice Captcha before submitting your fine-tuning request.

Custom AI models require fine-tuning and training, so PVCs will take longer (about 4 to 8 hours) compared to Instant Voice Clones.

## Recording audio for your PVC

### Recording Key Considerations

Before you upload your audio samples for Professional Voice Cloning (PVC), there are key considerations to keep in mind to achieve the best results.

1. **Recording Quality**
   Firstly, Professional Voice Cloning is highly accurate in cloning the samples used for its training. It will create a near-perfect clone of what it hears, including all the nuances and characteristics of that voice, but also including any artifacts and unwanted audio present in the samples. This means that if you upload low-quality samples with background noise, room reverb/echo, or any other type of unwanted sounds, the AI will try to replicate all of these elements in the clone as well. Making your model also have ample background noise, sibilance, or reverb. Please follow these guidelines for best results.

2. **Clear audio with a single speaker and no background music or sound effects**
   Ensure there’s only a single speaking voice throughout the audio, as more than one speaker or excessive noise or anything of the above can confuse the AI. This confusion can result in the AI being unable to discern which voice to clone or misinterpreting what the voice actually sounds like because it is being masked by other sounds, leading to a less-than-optimal clone.

3. **Use at least 30 mins to 3 hours of audio**
   The bare minimum we recommend is 30 minutes of audio, but for optimal results and the most accurate clone, we recommend closer to 2+ hours of audio. The more quality data you can feed into the AI, the better the voice clone will be. This can be either one long file, or several different files. If you choose to upload multiple audio files, make sure they have the same audio quality and are recorded in the same space. However, if you plan to upload multiple hours of audio, it is better to split it into multiple ~30-minute samples. This makes it easier to upload.

4. **Use a consistent delivery style**
   The speaking style in your samples will be replicated in the output. For consistent results, use one style per upload. For instance, if you're creating a voice model intended for audiobooks, submit recordings of yourself reading books in a consistent style, avoiding different character voices or else this will create errors in your voice model. This does not mean monotone or emotionless, feel free to vary your tone and emotion according to the context of the text.

5. **Use audio samples in the same language as your PVC model**
   For best results, use samples in the language you primarily intend the PVC for. While the AI can speak any supported language, cloning a voice from a different language may result in accents or mispronunciations. For example, if you clone an English voice for Spanish, it may retain an English accent. We only support cloning samples recorded in one of our supported languages, and the application will reject your sample if it is recorded in an unsupported language.

6. **Clone your own voice only**
   For now, we only allow you to clone your own voice. You will be asked to go through a verification process with our voice Captcha before submitting your fine-tuning request.

### Recording Quality Guidelines

Whether you’re new to voice recording or a seasoned professional. Here are some quality guidelines to consider. **Please note that if you're sharing your PVC in our Voice Library and it follows these guidelines and showcases consistent output**, your PVC **may** earn a High-Quality Badge in our Voice Library, enhancing your ranking and potential earnings!

**General recording guidelines:**

- **Use professional recording equipment:** The AI will clone everything in your audio. High-quality input = high-quality output. Opt for a professional XLR mic going into a dedicated audio interface.
- **Use a pop-filter**: This will minimize plosives when recording.
- **Microphone distance**: Position yourself at the right distance from the microphone - approximately two fists away from the mic is recommended, but it also depends on what type of recording you want.
- **Noise-free recording:** Ensure that the audio input doesn’t have any interference, like background music or noise. The AI cloning works best with clean, uncluttered audio.
- **Room acoustics:** Always record in an acoustically-treated room. This reduces unwanted echoes and background noises, leading to clearer audio input for the AI.
- **Audio pre-processing** (optional): You might find that adding light compression or other tools can improve your audio files before creating your PVC. Please note that excessive processing can have diminishing returns, so it’s best to be conservative with these effects.
- **Volume control:** Maintain a consistent volume that’s loud enough to be clear but not so loud that it causes distortion. The goal is to achieve a balanced and steady audio level. The ideal would be between -23dB and -18dB RMS with a true peak of -3dB.
- **Audio file format:** Mono, .wav, Minimum 44.1 kHz sample rate, and Minimum 16-bit depth

### Please avoid these technical recording issues:

- Room echo or "boxiness.”
- Background noise, including hiss, white noise, electrical hum, or external disturbances.
- Apparent editing issues (i.e. clicks, pops, audible cuts).
- Distortion, clipping, heavy compression, or excessive processing (i.e. noise gate, noise reduction plugin, normalization, EQ).
- Sibilance, loud breath noises, plosives, and mouth clicks.
- Repeats, mistakes, and long periods of silence (5 seconds or more).
- Voice level/input gain imbalance anywhere in the recording.

### Performance guidelines:

- Emphasis, intonations and emotions should align appropriately with the context of the text to create a realistic PVC.
- In some cases (e.g. audiobooks), emotional range and variance is helpful in delivering an engaging performance and creating a great AI voice. Our models can capture this emotional range, but the voice itself should remain consistent.
- **_Please vary your tone_** and pace naturally when reading. ✅
- **_Please avoid changing voices_** for different characters in a single recording or else this will create errors in your voice model. ❌
- Ensure correct and articulate pronunciation.
- Avoid sounding nasal, muffled, or wet (excess saliva).

## Beginner's Guide to Audio Recording

New to audio recording? Follow our guideline below!

**1) Recording Location**

When recording audio, choose a suitable location and set up to minimize room echo/reverb.
So, we want to "deaden" the room as much as possible. This is precisely what a vocal booth that is acoustically treated made for, and if you do not have a vocal booth readily available, you can experiment with some ideas for a DIY vocal booth, “blanket fort”, or closet.

Here are a few YouTube examples of DIY acoustics ideas:

- [I made a vocal booth for $0.00!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4wJMDUuHSM)
- [How to Record GOOD Vocals in a BAD Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsxdHtu-OpU)
- [The 5 BEST Vocal Home Recording TIPS!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K96mw2QBz34)

**2) 2) Equipment: Microphone, pop-filter, and audio interface**

A good microphone is crucial. Microphones range from $100 to $10,000, but a professional XLR microphone costing $150-$300 is sufficient for most voiceover work.

For an affordable yet high-quality setup for voiceover work, consider a **Focusrite** interface paired with an **Audio-Technica AT2020** or **Rode NT1 microphone**. This setup, costing between $300 to $500, offers high-quality recording suitable for professional use, with minimal self-noise for clean results.

Also, please ensure that you have a proper **pop-filter** in front of the microphone when recording to avoid plosives as well as breaths and air hitting the diaphragm/microphone directly, as it will sound poor and will also cause issues with the cloning process.

**3) Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)**

There are many different recording solutions out there that all accomplish the same thing: recording audio. However, they are not all created equally. As long as they can record WAV files at 44.1kHz or 48kHz with a bitrate of at least 24 bits, they should be fine. You don't need any fancy post-processing, plugins, denoisers, or anything because we want to keep audio recording simple.

If you want a recommendation, we would suggest something like **REAPER**, which is a fantastic DAW with a tremendous amount of flexibility. It is the industry standard for a lot of audio work. For a personal license or a discounted license, it is only $60. Another good free option is **Audacity**.

Maintain optimal recording levels (not too loud or too quiet) to avoid digital distortion and excessive noise. Aim for peaks of -6 dB to -3 dB and an average loudness of -18 dB for voiceover work, ensuring clarity while minimizing the noise floor. Monitor closely and adjust levels as needed for the best results based on the project and recording environment.

**4) Positioning**

One helpful guideline to follow is to maintain a distance of about two fists away from the microphone, which is approximately 20cm (7-8 in), with a pop filter placed between you and the microphone. Some people prefer to position the pop filter all the way back so that they can press it up right against it. This helps them maintain a consistent distance from the microphone more easily.

Another common technique to avoid directly breathing into the microphone or causing plosive sounds is to speak at an angle. Speaking at an angle ensures that exhaled air is less likely to hit the microphone directly and, instead, passes by it.

**5) Performance**

The performance you give is one of the most crucial aspects of this entire recording session. The AI will try to clone everything about your voice to the best of its ability, which is very high. This means that it will attempt to replicate your cadence, tonality, performance style, the length of your pauses, whether you stutter, take deep breaths, sound breathy, or use a lot of "uhms" and "ahs" – it can even replicate those. Therefore, what we want in the audio file is precisely the performance and voice that we want to clone, nothing less and nothing more. That is also why it's quite important to find a script that you can read that fits the tonality we are aiming for.

When recording for AI, it is very important to be consistent. if you are recording a voice either keep it very animated throughout or keep it very subdued throughout you can't mix and match or the AI can become unstable because it doesn't know what part of the voice to clone. same if you're doing an accent keep the same accent throughout the recording. Consistency is key to a proper clone!
